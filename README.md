<!-- Add buttons here -->

In this project, I will analyze the Titanic Wreck dataset. One of the most famous challenges, and perhaps the first for many people, from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which is a Machine Learning competition platform. I will analyze and send the results to the real competition, using the best positioned models, according to the pycaret module.
